This website is crafted using Hyper-text Markup Language (HTML) with a minimal incorporation of CSS. 
It has been developed and is currently managed by students without prior website design experience. 
As a result, we aimed to maintain simplicity in the code while ensuring functionality and elegance, showcasing the potency of basic HTML.
Due, its minimalistic design, the website is lightweight and loads quickly.
